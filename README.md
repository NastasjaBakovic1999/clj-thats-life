# What is a clj-thats-life? 

A simply implemented web application representing the popular board game ***That's Life***, which shows the consequences of the decisions we make in life and the fact that good decisions do not always lead to a series of good events, and vice versa.

## How to run?

To enjoy the charms of That's life, run the following command in the terminal

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. 

## Ok, now, what are the rules?
